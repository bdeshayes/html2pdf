# html2pdf
html to pdf command line converter written in PHP

from the command line type:
php html2pdf.php resources.html

the output will be found in resources.pdf

I wrote this utility to convert dozens of blogs into a downloadable ebook.

Obviously not all variations of html are supported (even some browsers can't do that...)
No stylesheets, no javascript but it does the job and is very compact.

Originally it was running on my websites to generate the ebooks on the fly.
All updates on the blogs would automatically find their way in the ebook as people would download.
